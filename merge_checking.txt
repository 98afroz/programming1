I have a website that has colored divs with numbers, e.g. a red block with the number 2 inside of it. The color is important to understanding. A blind user emailed me asking if I could make it say "2 red" for his screen reader.

I tried adding this as an alt="2 red" but he said that didn't do anything. He thinks it might only read alt tags for images.

Is there a good way to do this for divs?
